Good day,

We just wanted to share a quick update — a number of condo units have recently had price adjustments, and a few may be worth considering depending on what you’re looking for.

There are Studio, 1-Bedroom, and 2-Bedroom options available in central locations. Some are ready for move-in, while others are currently tenanted. If it helps, we can send you the latest list with prices and unit details, along with possible viewing schedules.

You can also browse current listings here:
